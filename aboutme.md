My name is _Justin Gunn_.
I have a lot of jeans.
And shoes. A lot of those.

Why I do this:
My name is Justin Gunn and I am a Sophomore. I may be a prospective Political Science major, however, I am taking CSCI 103 because I want to get a look at programming in a new context. While I do enjoy coding, I wish to see more interesting applications of computer programming outside of making computer functions or things of the sort. I also hope to learn about the useful skill of sewing as I believe that the skill could benefit me in the future.
