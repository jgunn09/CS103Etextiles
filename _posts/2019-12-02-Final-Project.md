Hello. I made a semi-working watch. And by semi-working I mean not working at all, but some things light up so that's a start. I thought it would be cool to make a watch so I went ahead and tried it.
The watch also has a heart rate monitor powered by a temperature sensor which controls the blinking of an rgb led.
To make this you need:
Conductive thread  
Fabric glue/paint/some insulator  
A large piece of felt  
13 LEDs  
Velcro (if you want to make it similar to an actual watch  
An Arduino with a button, switch, and temperature sensor  


This is my paper prototype for my watch design.

Up to this point the project was going well. The alligator clips showed that the project would work as intended

Here is where the project stop wanting to cooperate.

My tips for the future are  
1) Find a way to differentiate positive from negative traces using fabric paint or some embroidery  
2) Make sure your traces are connected to the arduino properly  
3) Fabric glue is not the best way to insulate traces so its better to just glue some fabric over the traces, which poses its own issues.
