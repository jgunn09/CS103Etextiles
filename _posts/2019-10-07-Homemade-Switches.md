Continuing to develop my sewing sampler, I have added two switches and an LED to the sampler. 
The switches are made of, two satin stiches of conductive thread for one, and a conductive fabric with a conductive thread for the other.
A tip I would give is to not rub your conductive switch on your battery because it makes sparks and that's kinda scary.
