![output](/img/Sweater.png)
This code is an attempt to create a program that will recommend whether you should put on a sweater depending on the temperature.
This output is an example of a recommendation at 40 degrees F.
A tip I would give is to make sure the code is organized so it's easy to see everything and to make sure all possiblities are covered.
