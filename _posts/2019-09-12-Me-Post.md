My name is Justin Gunn.
I'm a Sophomore and potential Political Science Major.
I have no sewing experience but I can program some stuff in Python.
I hope to learn how to sew because I always thought that was a useful skill and how to create a speaker stuffed animal.

A boring fact about me:
* I have 20/20 vision
